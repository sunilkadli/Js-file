Javascript is a both server side and client side programing and scripting language respectively.
It is the only language that can be used in both server side and client side
Founder of javascript is Brendan Eich.
it was introduced in the year 1995 for a company called Netscape

In 1997 Netscape handed in javascript to ECMA(EUROPEAN COMPUTERS MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION) , then Javascript has become ECMA script.
The first release of Javascript version is Javascript 1.0 in 1995.

Javascript which we use in front end is reffered as Venilla Javascript.


To use javascript don't need to download any software.
To run javascript we need one html file or document.

html file which linked with javascript file should run in the browser to execute javascript code.

Javascript code executes in browser and also out of the browser like we can execute Javascript even in our local machine but it is possible only with the help of Node Js


types of javascript implementations:
    1.Internal Javascript
    2.External Javascript

1.Internal Javascript:
    we will write js code in .html file by using a tag called script tag.
    we can use script tag in both head and body tag of html document, but it is recommended to use in body tag.

2.External Javascript:
    we will write the code in .js file and we need to link that external file with html file

Javascript behavior:
javascript is platform independent language / cross platform language.
Javascript is a loosely typed programing language
    ; is not mandatory to terminate the line of code
    etc....
Javascript is High level programing language
Javascript code executes line by line so it is referred as an interpreted programing language.


Browser:
Javascript Engine  , Javascript Runtime Environment are implemented in browsers in order to execute javascript code

Javascript Engines:
    Chrome - Googles's V8 js Engine
    FireFox - SpiderMonkey js Engine
    Edge - Chakra Js Engine
    OperaMini - CaraKan Js Engine
    etc.....



// In javascript to declare the variable we need to use keywords (var , let , const).
// In javascript we will not restrict a variable to store the data of a particular datatype , i.e while declaring the variable we will not use datatypes.

// A declared variable will get memory in javascript engine's  memory heap block or unit

//! Note : In javascript terminating a line of code using semicolon is not mandatory , bcs javascript is interpreted programing language , here by default a line of code will be terminated.

//! In javascript we have two types of comments
        //? 1. Multiline comment ( /* ..... */ )
        //? 2. Singleline comment ( // )

var x ;  //* declaration ,   once the variable is declared we can assign any type data(string , number , boolean etc...)
document.write(x); //* document.write() printing statement prints the results on the web page , here document refers to Html document(web page)
console.log(x); //* console.log() printing statement prints the results on browsers console , to get the console in webpage just right click on the web page and inspect the web page.

//! Default value of the declared variable in javascript is undefined.

    //? Javascript code execution:
        // we need to have one .js file to write javascript code
        // link that .js file to the html file where u need to execute the code
        // save the .js file and also html file
        // load the html file in browser in order to execute js code
